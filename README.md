# JS client list

This is a small personal project in order to develop a system which can add, delete and filter information inputted by the user from a form with name, birthdate and category. 

## BIRTHDATE
From the birthdate a new object is created with a readable date appearance.
From this information is calculated the client age

## FILTER
Using the regex technology gone create an input field while update every each information is inputted, so if a client called "Ricardo" and other called "Rodrigo" is registered, so if i start my research with "R" in the filter field, so both clients gone be showed while other going to be hide.
